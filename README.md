Welcome to Globe-Getter! Do you love to travel? Do you have a list at the back of your mind of all the places in the world you want to visit? Having a big list at the back of your mind can become overwhelming, and when it isn't cared for, you risk losing track of it or having those travel dreams fade away.

Users are able specify how many countries they would like to visit, select specific destinations to add to their goal, and see the progress of their goal. Not sure where you want to go? Globe-Getter also provides information about different countries for users who are unsure, and even has information on how much it would cost to travel to certian destinations from a user's home airport.
